Description: Template R package with minimal setup to use Rust code in R without
    hacks or frameworks. Includes basic examples of importing cargo dependencies,
    spawning threads and passing numbers or strings from Rust to R. The GitHub 
    repository for this package has more details and also explains how to set up
    CI. This project was first presented at 'Erum2018' to showcase R-Rust integration
    <https://jeroen.github.io/erum2018/>; for a real world use-case, see the 
    'gifski' package on 'CRAN'.
